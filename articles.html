                   these tiny offset rooms, which with a certain amount of force, could be fashioned
                   into livable spaces, though in my case – and I assume this is one of several marked
                   differences between myself and Divine – I was one of those self-relinquishing children
                   of the petty bourgeoisie who wished for an authentic bohemian independence while taking
                   money in desparation.</p>

                   Mountain in the Cloud: some scattered thoughts on David Rattray’s Opening the Eyelid</a></h4>
                   <p>A pneumatic fire breathing writer, David tries to surpass the limits of his context, but
                   toward what exactly? He is both the visionary coelacanth and the sonorous bat, muffled — each
                   seeing without seeing. Is Rattray’s purported lack of seeing related to Dana Ward’s inadequacy,
                   each a gift which makes their poetry possible in the first place? If there is vibrancy in these
                   poems there is also the still water calm and depth of someone who has a life behind them.</p>

                   Holy Laughter</a></h4>
                   <p>In the eighth scene of the Pompeii fresco, there’s a kneeling figure, probably the initiate, who’s sobbing, or maybe
                   laughing, in the lap of a haloed person whose eyes are fixed on the descending angel still clutching their whip. The seated
                   haloed figure, perhaps a teacher, gently caresses the initiate’s hair and, with an awkwardly bent right arm, scratches her back.
                   The teacher, Fierz-David tells us, has experienced her own transformative rite but refuses anodyne gestures of understanding – the
                   false empathy of “I’ve been there before.”</p>

                   <p>... this “greater than” is an excess beyond access, an ellipsis signifying the great beyond of an infinite series,
                   the n+1 of ineffable language, and the silence of a certain kind of privacy that is as multiple as it is diffuse and
                   that at the same time names a “code that could never be structurally secret.” And, so, while each, in their very iterability,
                   may be barred from the other, they are also inextricably bound by a certain sociability. Thus, failure gives ground to a fecund
                   range of possibilities that resist such easy co-existence. If what we have here is a failure to communicate, it is perhaps also
                   the possibility to commune.</p>

                   <p>... One of the things I’m most struck by, after reading Dana Ward’s “Typing Wild Speech,” is my own inability to respond to something that,
                   in almost every utterance, gives looping associations to savor, so many thought-lazonges to suck on, and when I finally try to write something
                   in response I’m immediately thrown back on my own inadequacies, which are, as I take it, central to the poem — well not my inadequacies but Dana’s,
                   or maybe, Inadequacy as a quasi-conceptual framework — which is to say the poem is attempting to “sound out the depths” of a burning hole, constituted
                   in great part by barely speakable loss. ...</p>

                   <p>... Refracting Rattray through Moten, we might think of tradition less as the hunky-dory mythos of grandfather time and
                   more as what Moten calls “the refuge of an ongoing displacement.” Along these lines, tradition refers to the always-already
                   provisional and improvisational habitus of a people trying to make their way through the muck and wreckage of history. The
                   movement through tradition by way of a process of repetition, revision and critique is what we might call, following Moten,
                   improvisation. And improvisation carries with it both the means toward life ...</p>

                   Viewpoint: Workplace Implications of California’s New Privacy Law</a></h4>
                   <p>Not long after the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation, California became the first state to
                   introduce its own suite of consumer privacy rules. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was signed into law
                   June 28 by Gov. Jerry Brown, includes many provisions aimed at bolstering consumers' privacy rights. Here's an overview of
                   the law and what it means for employers.</p>

                   The Man Leading the Charge Against the Specter of Voter Fraud</a></h4>
                   <p>Though the commission was dissolved earlier this year, Kobach and his acolytes have not given up on their fight against
                   the specter of voter fraud. During the lawsuit – argued in March – Kobach summoned his team of experts, and in doing so,
                   dug his own grave. Hans von Spakovsky, a legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, spoke about the pervasiveness of voter
                   fraud and the impact a small number of fraudulent voters can have on an election. [...] He later confessed that he couldn’t
                   “identify a single case where the outcome was decided by noncitizen voting.”</p>

                   use a gender-neutral facility, effectively alienating him from his classmates and teachers. Now, Max is a part of an ongoing lawsuit that, so far, is
                   working in his favor – and in favor of transgender youths throughout the US.</p>

                   <p>Alongside the burgeoning gig economy, there has emerged a set of intractable questions around workers’ rights and the application of certain regulations.
                   In Seattle, these questions came to a head, after the city council unanimously voted on an ordinance allowing Uber (and other ride-share) drivers to unionize
                   and negotiate with their employer.</p>
