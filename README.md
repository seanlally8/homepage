# Homepage
I wrote this website for pset8 of CS50x taught by David Malan. 

Styling for all pages is contained in style.css, in addition to the bootstrap, popper, and other links listed at the top of each html page. The website is broken down into 5 separate pages:

1. index.html --> home page, where the use can navigate to other pages.
2. about.html --> contains a brief "about me" section".
3. videos.html --> contains my youtube videos.
4. articles.html --> contains (or will contain) a list of articles I've written.
5. music.html --> contains list of streamable music. 

Below are some remaining tasks:

- [ ] Finish formatting submission form for newsletter
- [ ] Add articles to articles.html
- [ ] Add embedded streaming to music.html
- [ ] Develop basic blog structure
